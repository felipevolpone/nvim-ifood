> Você ta programando e de repente bateu aquela fome? Sem problemas, peça seu Ifood sem sair do seu editor de texto favorito 

Are you programming and suddenly your stomach is rumbling? No problem, order your Ifood without leaving your favorite text editor 

## how?

Using [neovim](https://neovim.io) [Go client](https://github.com/neovim/go-client).


## disclaimer

This is **obvisoully a joke**, even though it kinda works, I've made it just for fun :)
The code is terrible, because it's a **joke**, you got it?
The code is TERRIBLE, ok? really terrible. do not take any of this is consideration.

This is based on [Ifood](www.ifood.com.br) public APIs and it's not really possible to finish the order, but you can navigate around
and play with it.
